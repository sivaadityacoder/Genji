### Abstract
This paper introduces Genji, a novel framework designed to overcome the linguistic and analytical barriers faced by Japanese corporations in global markets. We propose a multi-stage pipeline that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform a chained sequence of tasks: automated data ingestion, cross-lingual translation, summarization, sentiment analysis, and topic modeling. The key contribution of this work is the final "Strategic Synthesis" module, which uses a persona-driven LLM prompt to transform unstructured, multi-lingual web data into actionable business strategy briefs in Japanese. Our results demonstrate that this framework can serve as an effective, scalable solution for real-time market intelligence.
