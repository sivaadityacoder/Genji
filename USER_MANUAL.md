# Project Genji: User Guide

Welcome to the Genji Global Insight Engine. This guide will help you understand and use the dashboard to make strategic decisions.

### How do I read the dashboard?

The dashboard is split into three sections:

1.  **Sentiment Trend Chart:** This line graph shows you the positive, negative, and neutral sentiment for your chosen topic over the last 30 days. A rising green line is good news.
2.  **Emerging Topics Cloud:** This is a "word cloud" showing the most frequently discussed topics. Larger words are more prominent topics.
3.  **Weekly Strategic Briefs:** This is the main section. It contains the AI-generated reports. Each report is dated and provides a summary of market trends, competitor moves, opportunities, and threats.

### How do I filter the results?

On the left-hand sidebar, you will find a dropdown menu. You can use this to filter the entire dashboard view for a specific topic, such as:
* "Our Company's Brand"
* "Our Main Competitor"
* "Our New Product"
