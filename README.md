### 🔥 The Problem: Japan's Global Blind Spot

* Japanese companies need to expand globally to survive, but face significant **language and cultural barriers**.
* It is impossible for executives to manually track foreign news, social media, and forums to understand **customer sentiment** and **competitor strategies**.
* Raw data is useless. They lack the tools to convert this flood of information into **actionable business strategy**.

### 🚀 The Solution: Project Genji

Project Genji is a fully automated pipeline that acts as an AI business analyst. It:
1.  **Ingests Data 24/7:** Scrapes and gathers data from diverse global sources (tech news, forums, social media).
2.  **Analyzes & Translates:** Uses a multi-stage LLM chain to translate, summarize, and analyze sentiment and trends.
3.  **Delivers Strategic Briefs:** Synthesizes all findings into a concise, 1-page strategic report in professional Japanese, delivered to a simple, clean dashboard.
